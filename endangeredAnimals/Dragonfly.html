   <p></p> The hines emerald dragonfly is the the most endangered species in the united states, acording to a study conducted by G.H. Bick in 1983,and documented much later by E.D. Chashatt in 1991. the
  order odonata, which includes dragonflies and damselflies, is cosmopolitan, and has about 5,309 species, as noted by C.A bridges in 1994. 

   <p></p>The hines emerald dragonflys life is at stake, endangered by the groundwater contamination, depletion, and pollution of wetlands.

   <p></p> they serve the enviroment as predetors, and prey. they eat many insects, including mosquitoes and biting flies and serve as prey to fish and birds, as well as helping with plant pollaination.
