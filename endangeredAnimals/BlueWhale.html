<h2>Blue Whales</h2>
  
 <p>  Blue whales are endangered in Massachusetts due to a number of factors. One of the primary reasons is the historical over-harvesting of blue whales for their valuable blubber and oil. In the early 20th century, these majestic creatures were hunted to near extinction, greatly reducing their population in the waters of Massachusetts. Additionally, the increasing levels of pollution in the ocean pose a significant threat to blue whales. Chemical pollutants and plastic waste can contaminate their food sources and disrupt their reproductive cycles, making it harder for them to survive and reproduce. There are only about 10,000-25,000 left. The blue whale is listed as endangered throughout its range under the ESA All of these factors add up to the reasons why blue whales are in danger of extinction.

  <p>Actions we can to do prevent this:</p>

  <p>We can respond to dead, injured, entangled, or washed up whales asap. Also, we can reduce noise pollution in the ocean. Reducing vessel strikes is another way to save the whales. Cracking down on illegal whaling ships, cleaning up oceans from fishing nets and other dangerous debris, as well as nurturing baby whales to make sure they survive are more ways.</p>
