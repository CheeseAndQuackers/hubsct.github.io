  <h4 style="font-size:150%;">Barn Owls are of least concern but they are still endangered</h4>
  
  <h4 style="font-size:150%;">1. Barn Owls swallow their prey wholeâ€”skin, bones, and all. About twice a day, they cough up pellets instead of passing all that material through their digestive tracts. The pellets make a great record of what the owls have eaten, and scientists study them to learn more about the owls and the ecosystems they live in. 2. Up to 46 different races of the Barn Owl have been described worldwide. The North American form is the largest, weighing more than twice as much as the smallest race from the Galapagos Islands.</h4>
